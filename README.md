# Airlines-Customers-Satisfaction-Classification-
# Overview
This project aims to predict customer satisfaction with airline services based on various features. The dataset includes information about airline passengers, such as flight details, onboard services, and customer feedback. We utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, data preprocessing methods, and implemented a logistic regression model to classify customer satisfaction.

# Methodology
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and discover potential insights.
Visualized key relationships between variables using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
Performed data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
### 3. Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression
Implemented a logistic regression model to classify customer satisfaction based on the processed dataset.
Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualized model evaluation results to gain insights into its performance.
